# Here Comes Treble!
 
Hello and welcome to our Basic Music Theory app for children aged 4-7! 
We created this app while particpating in a Hackathon ran by our school, General Assembly.
We wanted to provide a simple, fun app to spark a child's interest in Music.

## How to Use the App:

1. Upon opening the app you will see an option to either sign up or start learning. Choose one.
2. If you chose to sign up, create account.
3. If you chose to start learning, hover over the image to hear a preview of song. Click arrows to cycle through songs.
4. Click image of song you would like to learn.
5. On the GamePage, click the piano key that corresponds to the picture. Keys will turn red for wrong notes.
6. Once the song is finished, the app will redirect you to the song selection page.

### Technology Stack and NPM Packages Used:

#### How it Went Overall:

Day 1: We started the Hackathon by being assigned to our groups and what type of app we would be building. After the opening ceremony, we dove right into 
brainstorming ideas and quickly came up with this app idea. From there, the development team gathered research on like projects and plug-ins that we could use for 
our app.
